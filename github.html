Chapter 4: Hosting Your Website on GitHub

Introduction:
In this chapter, we will dive into the exciting world of hosting your website on GitHub. Whether you have a personal blog, a portfolio site, or a small business website, GitHub provides a simple and efficient way to showcase your web content to the world. By the end of this guide, you will have the knowledge and skills to import your website files into a GitHub repository and set up GitHub Pages for hosting. Let's get started!

Section 4.1: Importing Your Website Files to GitHub
To host your website on GitHub, you first need to import your website files into a GitHub repository. Follow these steps to import your files:

Step 1: Create a New Repository
1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the main dashboard.
2. Click on the "New" button to create a new repository.
3. Give your repository a descriptive name, such as "my-website".
4. Optionally, provide a brief description for your repository.
5. Choose the visibility of your repository (public or private).
6. Click the "Create repository" button to create the repository.

Step 2: Clone the Repository
1. Once your repository is created, you will be redirected to the repository page.
2. Under the repository name, click on the green "Code" button.
3. Copy the repository URL provided (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/my-website.git).

Step 3: Set Up Git and Clone the Repository
1. Open your preferred Git client or command line interface.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store your local copy of the repository.
3. Run the following command, replacing [repository-url] with the URL you copied in Step 2:

```
git clone [repository-url]
```

Step 4: Add Your Website Files
1. Copy your website files into the cloned repository directory on your local machine.
2. Use the following Git commands to add and commit your files:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Step 5: Push Your Changes to GitHub
1. Push your local repository to GitHub using the following command:

```
git push origin main
```

Section 4.2: Configuring GitHub Pages for Hosting
Now that your website files are imported into a GitHub repository, it's time to configure GitHub Pages for hosting your site. Follow these steps:

Step 1: Access Repository Settings
1. Go to your GitHub repository page for your website.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab near the top-right corner of the page.

Step 2: Scroll Down to GitHub Pages Section
1. Scroll down the settings page until you find the "GitHub Pages" section.
2. In the "Source" dropdown, select the branch that contains your website files (e.g., "main").

Step 3: Save the Changes
1. After selecting the appropriate branch, click the "Save" button.
2. GitHub will automatically save your settings and generate a URL for your hosted website.

Step 4: Access Your Website
1. Once the settings are saved, scroll back down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
2. You will find the URL of your hosted website (e.g., https://your-username.github.io/my-website).
3. Click on the URL to visit your newly hosted website.

Section 4.3: Custom Domain Configuration (Optional)
If you have a custom domain for your website, you can configure it to work with your GitHub Pages-hosted site. Follow these steps:

Step 1: Obtain a Custom Domain
1. Purchase a custom domain from a domain registrar of your choice (e.g., GoDaddy,

 Namecheap).
2. Note down the domain name (e.g., www.yourdomain.com).

Step 2: Configure DNS Settings
1. Access the DNS settings for your custom domain through your domain registrar's website.
2. Create a new CNAME record pointing to your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., your-username.github.io).
3. Save the DNS changes.

Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go back to your GitHub repository settings.
2. In the "Custom domain" field, enter your custom domain (e.g., www.yourdomain.com).
3. Save the changes.

Step 4: Update DNS with Registrar
1. Return to your domain registrar's website and navigate to the DNS settings for your domain.
2. Update the DNS settings to include the GitHub Pages IP addresses provided in the GitHub Pages settings.
3. Save the DNS changes.

Step 5: Verify and Test
1. Wait for DNS changes to propagate (usually takes a few minutes to a few hours).
2. Visit your custom domain (e.g., www.yourdomain.com) in a web browser to verify that your GitHub Pages-hosted website is accessible.
